# Redwine Quality Prediction #

### Dataset in the repository is taken from UCI Machine Learning ###
- [Red Wine Quality](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009)

### Description ###
Quality wine is important as world's wine consumption is over 1.1 billion gallons in 2021 already. It is hard to value a wine based on human quality assessment. We can use the features of a wine to accurately predict the quality score of a wine using algorithms. In this project we are going to build prediction model for the red wine based on 10 features and 4 strongest correlation features.
